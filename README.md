### I. Configure yocto/oe Environment

In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you need to download the corresponding layers described in the "Dependencies" section. Be sure that everything is in the same directory.

```shell
~ $ mkdir yocto; cd yocto
~/yocto $ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky -b dunfell
~/yocto $ cd poky
~/yocto/poky $ git clone https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded.git -b dunfell
~/yocto/poky $ git clone https://github.com/JeffyCN/meta-rockchip.git -b dunfell
~/yocto/poky $ git clone https://github.com/engicam-stable/meta-engicam-rockchip.git -b dunfell
```

And put the meta-engicam-rockchip layer here too.

Then you need to source the configuration script:

```shell
~/yocto $ source poky/oe-init-build-env
```

Having done that, you can build a image for a engicam board by adding the location of the meta-engicam-rockchip layer to bblayers.conf, along with any other layers needed.

For example:

```makefile
# build/conf/bblayers.conf
BBLAYERS ?= " \
  ${TOPDIR}/../poky/meta \
  ${TOPDIR}/../poky/meta-poky \
  ${TOPDIR}/../poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
  ${TOPDIR}/../poky/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
  ${TOPDIR}/../poky/meta-rockchip \
  ${TOPDIR}/../poky/meta-engicam-rockchip \
```

To enable a particular machine, you need to add a MACHINE line naming the BSP to the local.conf file:

```makefile
  MACHINE = "px30-icore"
  DISTRO_FEATURES:remove += " x11"
```

All supported machines can be found in meta-engicam-rockchip/conf/machine.

### II. Building meta-engicam-rockchip BSP Layers

You should then be able to build a image as such:

```shell
$ bitbake engicam-image-weston
```

At the end of a successful build, you should have an .wic image in /path/to/yocto/build/tmp/deploy/\<MACHINE\>/.

### III. Booting your Device

```shell
$ sudo dd if=engicam-image-weston-px30-icore.wic of=/dev/sdb bs=64M && sync
```

### IV. Tested Hardwares

The following undergo regular basic testing with their respective MACHINE types.

* px30 icore starterkit 2.0 board
